# Description : 
The house price predictor uses 13 features to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes. The data is read from a csv file, analysed, and splitted 
into training and testing data using stratified shuffle split.
Three models are trained based on different regression algorithms and cross validation evaluation is done for each of them.
